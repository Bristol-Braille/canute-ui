"This is the library menu. From this menu, you can view and select from the "
"files loaded onto the memory stick or SD card. As with other menus, press "
"the line select key to the left of a menu item to select it. Canute 360 will"
" then display your chosen file on the reading surface. Navigate within the "
"menu using the \"forward\" and \"back\" buttons. To load books onto your "
"canute, first turn it off by pressing the button to the right of the power "
"socket on the back panel. Once the \"please wait\" text disappears, remove "
"the memory stick or SD card you are using. Copy and paste a BRF or PEF file "
"onto the stick or card, using a computer, insert the stick or card into the "
"slot. Turn your Canute on again, and once it has started your file will be "
"in the library menu. As with all menus, select your file using the line "
"select button to it's left. For best results, format BRF files with nine "
"lines of forty cells per page in software. Duxbury DBT and RoboBraille have "
"a Canute preset built in for formatting."
